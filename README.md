    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Jellyfin app for Roku with Intro Skip Support</h1>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Forked from the <a href="https://jellyfin.media/">Jellyfin</a> Project</h3>
</p>

The Jellyfin Roku with Intro Skip App is a Jellyfin client for Roku Devices. This is an **unofficial** fork of the [Jellyfin Roku App](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-roku) which is meant to work with the [Intro-Skipper Jellyfin Plugin](https://github.com/ConfusedPolarBear/intro-skipper). This fork will be maintained until introduction skipping is pulled into the official Jellyfin core.

## Getting Started

This app is not available on the Roku Channel Store (the official Jellyfin app on the Channel Store does not support intro skipping at this time). To install this app, your Roku must be in [Developer Mode](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/getting-started/developer-setup.md). Then you can download the latest release and upload it to your Roku. More instructions are in the [DEVGUIDE](DEVGUIDE.md).
